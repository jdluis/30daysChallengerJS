    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2) //output: 100 100
    age = 200
    console.log(age, age2) //output: 200 100

    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);  // output: Wes, Wes
    name = 'wesley';
    console.log(name, name2); // output: wesley, Wes
    
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const teamReference = players;
    console.log(players, teamReference);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    teamReference[3] = 'Lux'; 

    // however what happens when we update that array?


    /*
    In that case, team is only a reference of players, 
    so if we change one value in team we will se the change in players
    */

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const teamCopy = players.slice();
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const teamCopy2 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const teamCopy3 = [...players]; //copy
    teamCopy3[3]="Dani"; //edit the value 3 only in this
    console.log(players, teamCopy3); 

    const teamCopy4 = Array.from(players); //is a copy too

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    const personReference = person;
    personReference.country = "ES";
    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const personCopy = Object.assign({}, person, {number : 99});
    console.log(personCopy);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const personCopy3 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 22,
      social: {
        instagram: "000@ppee",
        Linkedin: "@ldijv",
      }
    };

    console.log(wes);
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes); //only for 1 level, for more levels will be a reference
    const dev2 =  JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); //deepClone
